        <h3 class="w3-center">WHAT IS A SMART CITY?</h3>
        <p "w3-left w3-medium"> The term “Smart Cities” has come to be used as code for the digitalization of city services and infrastructure
           for the purpose of improved government-citizen interaction and increased economic development.</p>
        <p "w3-left w3-medium">Smart cities and communities have deployed or are in the process of deploying ICT, data analysis, AI and other
            technology to transform their local government and infrastructure to better serve and involve the citizens.
            As students, we study and participate in projects in the are of smart cities/communities. This includes policy
            changes, career path transformation, citizen outreach, along with the technology adoption.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-half">
        <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT SMART CITIES @ GW</h3>
        <p>Smart Cities @ GW aims to improve the abilities of students to professionalize the Smart City movement, create a
        place where students can readily access the best information about smart cities technologies, policies and projects,
        and businesses and organizations within the Smart Cities area of activity.</p>
        <p>Our areas of interest include but are not limited to:  Data Analytics, AI, machine learning, IoT and sensing technologies,
        government platforms, utility transformation, transportation system digitalization, health informatics, policing
        strategies, enabling policies for newly digitized markets, privacy and security.</p>
        <p>The term Smart Cities can mean many different things. Smart Cities @ GW looks at the technology, practices, and policies
          as the future of place and opportunity. Understanding the technology at the heart of a smart community, the supporting
          infrastructure, hardware, and the policies that puts them to work for the good of all citizens is what we aim for in our
          education and projects. George Washington University students will be the workforce that Smart Cities need along a spectrum
          of industries and careers.</p>

          <h3>What is a Hackathon?</h3>
          <p>A hackathon is best described as an “invention marathon”. Anyone who
          has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build, & share
           their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming
           atmosphere. You don’t have to be a programmer and you don’t have to be
           majoring in Computer Science. We have cool hardware to play with and lots
            of workshops to introduce participants to technology and the idea of Smart Cities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-half">
          <h3>What is Hackital?</h3>
          <p>Hackital is a hackathon in the capital.
      We are focused on mentorship and learning. We give participants
      resources and incentives to go out of their way to learn new things from
       each other and apply the skills they have. By the end of a hackathon
      weekend we hope people will have created cool new things and also become
       better problem solvers.</p>

      <div class="w3-row-padding" style="margin-top:64px">
        <div class="w3-half">
          <h3>Who can participate?</h3>
          <p>Anyone can apply to participate in the
    Hackathon. Applications are based on interest in Smart Cities and
    demonstrated ability to code or meaningfully contribute to a project.
    Applications from any corner of the globe will be accepted. PLEASE NOTE
    that non-technical contributors are welcome as well. If you
     have something you think you can add to the ecosystem – whether it's a
    passion for Smart Cities, a creative or artistic
     perspective, or an entrepreneurial vision – we'd welcome your talents and
    skills on one of the Hackathon teams</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-half">
          <h3>How much does the event cost to attend?</h3>
          <p>Short answer: nothing. Longer answer: Hackathons are great
     places to learn new things and exchange ideas. We think that charging
    for admission would seriously diminish this so there will never be any
    charge for attending any Hackital event.</p>

    accommodate anyone’s specific needs.</p>

        <div class="w3-half">
          <h3>Where can I sleep?</h3>
          <p>Grab a soylent and some coffee and hack
    through the night! If that doesn’t appeal to you, we will have gender
    separated silent dark rooms but don’t provide any sleeping
    accommodations, so bring your own sleeping bag if you’d like to lay down
     at some point.</p>

          <p>Not a problem! You can find all things
    you can find at the event. We also have a partnership with Hacker Match
    that will allow you to build teams before the event.</p>

          <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
          <p>Bring a valid ID, anything you need to
    hack with (like a laptop), toiletries, and some enthusiasm! Additionally
     you might want to bring a sleeping bag and pillow if you plan on
    sleeping, and a change of clothes. An extension cord / surge protector
    would be great too.</p>

        <h3>How does judging work?</h3>
        <p>Every team will get a few minutes to
    pitch their idea and show a demo to a panel of experienced judges. We
    want to focus on technical difficulty and not just UI.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="w3-half">
        <h3>How big can my team be?</h3>
        <p>Teams can be as large as you like, but
    prizes are only for teams of up to 4 people so we suggest you aim for
    teams of 4.</p>
